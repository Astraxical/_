# Ideas for Multi-House Application Enhancement - Testing Improvements

## 1. Comprehensive Test Coverage
- Add unit tests for all core functionality
- Implement integration tests for module interactions
- Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows

## 2. Test Data Management
- Create fixtures for different alter states
- Implement test data factories
- Add test data cleanup mechanisms

## 3. Mocking Strategies
- Mock external services in tests
- Create test doubles for database operations
- Mock template rendering for faster tests

## 4. Performance Testing
- Add load testing scenarios
- Implement stress testing for critical endpoints
- Monitor application performance under load

## 5. Security Testing
- Add vulnerability scanning to CI/CD pipeline
- Implement security-focused tests
- Test for common security vulnerabilities

## 6. Automated Testing Pipeline
- Set up continuous integration testing
- Add automated code quality checks
- Implement test reporting and metrics
